# FrickGlow
Ever wondered what Geometry Dash levels would look like without glow? Here you go!

<c-ffff00>(This mod does *not* affect objects shown in the level editor, and will not do so anytime soon. You can continue using [undefined0's Object Glow In Editor](mod:undefined0.object_glow_in_editor) or a similar feature in more recent versions of [Ninkaz's Editor Utils](mod:ninkaz.editor_utils) without worrying about mod conflicts.)</c>
