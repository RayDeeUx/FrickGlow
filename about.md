# FrickGlow
Ever wondered what Geometry Dash levels would look like without glow? Here you go!

Disclaimers:
\- Under certain circumstances, this mod may crash your game. This is typically the result of level creators lacking the 20/20 foresight necessary to avoid assigning gradient decoration objects as group parents. As of writing this, Android players will need to disable hiding gradient objects entirely; you can choose between skipping the individual gradient object when loading a level or hiding 99% of gradient objects.

Made with much-appreciated help from:
\- TechStudent10 (massive refactor)
\- cgytrus and matcool (meaningful function hooking)
\- dankmeme01 and Firee (CCSprite hiding strategy + general C++ syntax wrangling)
\- ItsLever (disabling Gradient trigger strategy)
\- poweredbypie (Gradient trigger conditional statement code golf)
